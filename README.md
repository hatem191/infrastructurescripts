# infrastructurescripts
Scripts used for infrastructure setup

This repository contains scripts that are used to do a variety of DevOps tasks. They are created in python to do a variety of different kinds of tasks in a pipeline. This can be something, like an audit, a backup, creation of an alert, encryption or some other task.

I will keep updating this repository, to create a helpful repository that may help in fullfilling some task in a CICD pipeline.

Thank you for visiting my Infrastructure Github repository.
